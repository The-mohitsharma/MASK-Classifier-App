# MASK-Classifier-App

This Repository Contains the Projects Developed in Andriod(java).
The primary purpose of this project is to take a tensor flow model from the teachable machine and trained it with different classes and interfaces and export all classes and download them as a TensorFlow model. 
 After exporting I trained a model with that exported dataset and convert it into a Tensor flow lite model and run it into the mobile application.

so here I will take a tensor flow model from [the Teachable machine platform] then convert it into a tf life model and download a model. tflite and import it into the android studio.



## Tech Stack

**LANGUAGE:** JAVA.

**LIBRARIES:** Tensorflow and Tensorflow lite
